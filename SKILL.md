name: brand-kit
description: Establish and enforce per-client brand fidelity using the DESIGN.md standard (google-labs-code/design.md). Use whenever starting work for a client, creating any ad/landing-page/creative, or when brand colors/fonts/spacing are needed. Auto-extracts a client's visual identity into a validated DESIGN.md, keeps a central registry, and feeds the tokens into image-studio (statics), fb-ad-video-studio (video), and landing pages. Triggers: "set up brand for <client>", "make a DESIGN.md", "match the client's brand", "what are their brand colors", "new client onboarding", any creative work that must be on-brand.

# brand-kit

One verified source of truth for a client's visual identity, in the open **DESIGN.md** format (`google-labs-code/design.md`). Every ad and landing page reads from it, so nothing is ever off-brand — and **nothing is ever fabricated**.

## The hard rule

**Never invent or assume a client's brand colors, fonts, or identity.** If a verified DESIGN.md doesn't exist, you extract from real assets and *flag every uncertainty* for human confirmation. A guessed hex is a defect, not a placeholder. This skill exists to make that rule structural.

## What DESIGN.md is

Plain text: YAML front-matter **tokens** (`name`, `colors`, `typography`, `rounded`, `spacing`, `components`) + a markdown **body** of rationale (Overview, Colors, Typography, Layout, Elevation & Depth, Shapes, Components, Do's and Don'ts). Tokens are normative; prose says how to apply them. Token aliasing via `{colors.primary}`. Validated by `npx @google/design.md lint` (broken refs + **WCAG contrast**) and `diff` (brand regression). See `references/spec-summary.md` (offline copy of the spec).

## Where it lives

- **Registry (authoritative):** `~/claude_work/brand-kits/<client-slug>/DESIGN.md`
- **Per project (copy):** the ad or landing-page project gets a copy via `scripts/sync.sh`, which writes a header pointing back to the registry and can `diff` to detect drift.

## Per-client workflow

1. **Extract** — `python3 scripts/extract-brand.py --url <client-site> [--logo logo.png] --client <slug>`. Screenshots the site, samples real palette (PIL quantize), scrapes CSS for hex values + `font-family`, drafts `brand-kits/<slug>/DESIGN.md`. Anything not confidently detected is written as `# TODO: VERIFY` — never a guess.
2. **Verify (human gate)** — review the draft with the user. Resolve every `TODO: VERIFY`. Do not proceed to creative work with unresolved TODOs.
3. **Lint** — `bash scripts/lint.sh brand-kits/<slug>/DESIGN.md`. Fix contrast/ref errors. This is the quality gate.
4. **Register** — the verified, lint-clean file is now authoritative in the registry.
5. **Propagate** — `bash scripts/sync.sh <slug> <project-dir>` copies it into the ad/landing-page project.
6. **Consume** — `python3 scripts/tokens-to-css.py` emits `:root{}` CSS custom properties and a Tailwind theme snippet from the tokens. Every downstream skill uses these instead of hardcoded values.

## Integration (the point)

Full detail in `references/integration.md`. Summary:

- **image-studio (statics):** before rendering, check for a project DESIGN.md. Map `colors.*` → the template `:root` vars (`--accent`, `--ink`, …), `typography.*` → font stacks. The reverse-template color-sampling step *becomes* `extract-brand.py`. No DESIGN.md → extract + ask, don't guess.
- **fb-ad-video-studio (video):** HyperFrames reads `design.md`/`DESIGN.md` natively. `sync.sh` the client file into the composition project root → captions, lockups, kinetic type inherit brand automatically. Also map tokens → the template `--accent/--ink` `:root` vars.
- **Landing pages:** run `tokens-to-css.py` → drop the `:root` block into the page stylesheet (or the Tailwind snippet into the theme). Lint gates contrast before deploy.

## When to use / not

**Use:** client onboarding; any creative that must be on-brand; resolving "what are their colors"; auditing an existing asset against the brand (`diff`).

**Don't use:** generic/demo work with no real client (use neutral placeholders — do not invent a brand). One-off internal scratch.

## Client launch package (presentation-grade)

The internal `DESIGN.md` (and `DESIGN.preview.*`) carry provenance, corrections,
and lint notes — **never send those to a client.** For a launch call, generate
the client-safe deliverable:

```bash
python3 scripts/client-brand-sheet.py <registry>/DESIGN.md \
  --client "<Client Name>" --agency "<Your Agency>" \
  --ads-dir <client>/creatives/campaign_<n> \
  --out <client>/launch-package
node scripts/render-sheet.js <client>/launch-package/brand-foundations.html
```

Produces `brand-foundations.pdf` + `.png`: a single branded one-pager (palette
with friendly labels, type, components, the client's brand colors styling the
sheet itself, and an optional strip of the first ad concepts). All internal
language is stripped; it refuses to run if any `TODO: VERIFY` remains. Requires
Playwright (uses the sibling `image-studio` skill's copy if not installed here).

Host teams: sequence this into onboarding as
intake → brand extract/verify/lint → sync/tokens → initial concepts →
launch package (a project-level onboarding SOP can codify the exact commands).

## Output

A registered, lint-clean `brand-kits/<slug>/DESIGN.md` + generated CSS/Tailwind
tokens wired into the client's projects, and (for launch) a client-safe
`launch-package/brand-foundations.pdf`. The DESIGN.md is the source of truth;
everything else reads from it.
